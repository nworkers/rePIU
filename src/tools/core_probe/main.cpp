// Task 501. The probes that depend on nothing platform-specific, gathered into
// one binary that builds on every host.
//
// repiu_aot_probe cannot serve this purpose: most of its 56 probes reach into
// the Win32 execution layer, so making it build elsewhere would mean excluding
// most of it and leaving one binary that verifies different things depending on
// the operating system. This target instead holds only what is genuinely
// shared, so the same assertions can be compared directly across platforms.
// Windows loses no coverage, because repiu_aot_probe still runs these same
// probes there.
//
// Membership was decided by compiling and linking, not by reading includes: a
// probe can name a header like `dos/dos_int21_services.h` that resolves into
// the Win32 layer only through an include directory, which no amount of
// grepping for "win32" reveals.

// Task 513: six of the fifteen are compiled out for wasm32, and the binary says
// so on every run rather than reporting a smaller total in silence.
//
// The reason differs by probe and both reasons are real. Two of them --
// stack_bridge and guest_stack_switch -- are inline x86 assembly and do not
// reach the compiler at all. The other four exercise the platform facilities
// wasm does not have, so on this host they would only ever measure that the
// Stage 1 stubs return false, which is a fact the stubs already state.
//
// Excluding them is not the same as their passing. `core_probe_skipped` below
// keeps that distinction on screen, because "9 of 9 passed" printed alone would
// read as a complete run.
