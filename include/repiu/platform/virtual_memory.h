// Task 503b. Reserving, protecting, and asking about virtual memory, without
// naming an operating system.
//
// The Win32 engine calls VirtualProtect at 50 sites, VirtualFree at 30,
// VirtualAlloc at 16, and VirtualQuery at 16. Those four do not port as a set:
// mprotect and mmap correspond closely, but VirtualQuery has no cheap Linux
// counterpart -- answering it there means parsing /proc/self/maps -- and
// mprotect, unlike VirtualProtect, does not report the protection it replaced.
//
// Rather than mirror the Win32 shapes and pay for them on Linux, this API asks
// what the call sites actually ask. Two findings from reading all 112 of them
// shaped it:
//
//   * No caller ever passes PAGE_GUARD, PAGE_WRITECOPY, or PAGE_NOACCESS to
//     VirtualProtect. They appear only inside five separate hand-written
//     "is this protection readable" classifiers, which disagree in their
//     details. MemoryRegion answers that question directly instead.
//
//   * The protection VirtualProtect reports as previous IS consumed -- the
//     guest store path protects a page writable, writes, and puts the old
//     protection back. Linux cannot report it, so the Linux backend records
//     what it set and hands that back.
//
// See docs/design/20260822-503-linux-execution-engine.md.
