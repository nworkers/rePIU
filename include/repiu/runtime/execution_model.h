// Task 759. How this host runs the guest, answered in one place.
//
// The guest is 32-bit x86 code. A 32-bit x86 host (Win32, Linux i386) runs the
// guest's own bytes in this process: the `direct` model. An x86-64 host cannot,
// because long mode reads some of those encodings differently (Task 550), so it
// runs the translated long-mode code cache instead (Task 546): the `cache`
// model. A host that runs no guest at all (the web build) is the `none` model.
//
// That is the one difference by architecture above the platform layer, and
// these functions are where shared code asks about it. They are implemented in
// src/runtime/execution_model_direct.cpp, execution_model_cache.cpp and
// execution_model_none.cpp; CMake builds the one that matches the host
// (REPIU_EXECUTION_MODEL). Code that differs by model and needs the engine's
// types sits next to its shared file as <name>_direct.cpp and
// <name>_cache.cpp.
